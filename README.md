# (iOS) Facebook Login Button

## Objective
This is sample source code for my medium article "(iOS) Facebook Login Button".

[(iOS) Facebook Login Button](https://medium.com/@KentaKodashima/ios-facebook-login-button-fc715818b410)

**Note:**  
It is not going to work if you just download the project from the repository because some files are not included for security reasons. You need your own 'GoogleService-Info.plist' and app ID in Info.plist. You also need to configure your project to use with Firebase and Facebook Login SDK.

Please check my Medium article for the implementation details.
